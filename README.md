The project will begin by importing the dataset and cleaning it to remove any irrelevant or missing data. The data will be explored using summary statistics, visualizations, and other analytical techniques to gain insights into the Netflix content library.

The following are the steps that will be followed in the project:

- Data Import and Cleaning: Import the dataset into R and clean it to remove any irrelevant or missing data. This will involve identifying and addressing any data quality issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the Netflix content library. This will involve visualizing the data using charts and graphs to identify patterns, trends, and relationships. The EDA will be performed on various attributes such as release year, genre, country, and runtime.

- Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical analysis to identify any significant trends or patterns in the data. This will involve hypothesis testing and regression analysis to determine the impact of various attributes on the popularity of the content.

- Visualizations: Create visualizations to present the findings from the data analysis in an easily understandable format.

The project will be documented in a report that outlines the steps taken in the analysis, the results obtained, and the recommendations made. The report will also include visualizations and code snippets used in the analysis.
